```python
from readmefile import GitHubRepoAnalyzer

# Initialize the analyzer
analyzer = GitHubRepoAnalyzer()

# Analyze the repository
analyzer.analyze_github_repo('your-repo-url')

# Generate the README data
readme_data = analyzer.generate_readme_data()

# Print or save the README content
print(readme_data)
